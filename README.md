Housestays data analysis and price prediction using supervised algorithms.
🏡 Excited to share my latest project on Homestays Data Analysis and Price Prediction! 📊💰

I've just completed a comprehensive analysis of homestay listings, leveraging advanced techniques in data science and machine learning. Here's a summary of what I've accomplished:

🔍 Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: Enhanced the dataset by creating actionable features such as `Host_Tenure`, `Amenities_Count`, and `Days_Since_Last_Review` to provide insights into host experience, property offerings, and listing activity.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth exploration to uncover patterns and relationships between pricing (`log_price`) and various features like `room_type`, `property_type`, and numerical attributes. Utilized statistical tools and visualizations to understand the data distribution and correlations.

🗺️ Geospatial Analysis: Investigated regional pricing trends by plotting listings on maps and examining geographical factors influencing pricing, such as neighborhood characteristics and proximity to city centers.

💬 Sentiment Analysis on Textual Data: Applied natural language processing techniques to analyze listing descriptions and extract sentiment scores, exploring the impact of positive or negative descriptions on pricing.

🛋️ Amenities Analysis: Thoroughly parsed and analyzed amenities to identify correlations with pricing, informing both pricing strategy and model inputs.

🔠 Categorical Data Encoding: Transformed categorical data into machine-readable format using one-hot encoding, ensuring compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

🤖 Model Development and Training: Developed and trained predictive models including linear regression, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting to estimate `log_price`, documenting the model-building process and rationale behind algorithm choices.

🎯 Model Optimization and Validation: Systematically optimized models using techniques like grid search and validated model performance through k-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability to unseen data.

🔍 Feature Importance and Model Insights: Analyzed trained models to identify significant features impacting `log_price`, utilizing techniques like feature importance scores and SHAP values for deeper insights.

📉 Predictive Performance Assessment: Evaluated the final model's performance on a reserved test set using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, providing a detailed analysis of residuals to check for biases or misfit.

Excited to share my learnings and insights from this project! Looking forward to further discussions and collaborations in the data science community. #DataScience #MachineLearning #HomestaysAnalysis #PricePrediction 🚀📊
